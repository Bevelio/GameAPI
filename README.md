GameAPI
=======

Pretty amazing GameAPI that combines the OCTC &amp; Mineplex game system.

Uses the FifthDimension API, but doesd not need it to function. Just replaced the methods it uses and you're good to go!

Uses an Arena Object system like other Minigames, but has a Game Object system for each game. 

To join a game, you do /game <MobType> <GameName> , and this will spawn a mob with the name of the game, and when you right-click that mob, it opens up an inventory full of wool, each piece representing an Arena. The color of the wool depends on how many players on in that arena. Click the wool to join the game! (The Arenas are hard-coded into the you make, so no editing in the config. You could write a way to do that, but that would take a while. Wait, that's a pretty good idea. I should do that.)
